# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions – Preponderous Non-Commercial License (Preponderous-NC)

This FAQ is intended to clarify common questions about using, modifying, and licensing projects under the **Preponderous Non-Commercial License (Preponderous-NC)**.

---

## 1. Who owns the rights to Preponderous Software projects?

> **Preponderous Software is not a legal entity.**  
> All rights are held by **Daniel McCoy Stephenson**, the sole copyright holder.

Preponderous Software is the name of the open-source organization under which these projects are developed and maintained, but legal ownership rests entirely with Daniel McCoy Stephenson.

---

## 2. Can I use the software for personal or educational purposes?

Yes. You may use, modify, and self-host the software **freely** for personal, educational, and research purposes as long as your use is **non-commercial** and complies with the license terms.

---

## 3. What counts as “commercial use”?

Commercial use includes (but is not limited to):

- Selling the software or offering it as part of a paid product/service  
- Charging for access, subscriptions, or premium features  
- Hosting the software with monetized ads or sponsorships  
- Using the software in a corporate, enterprise, or government environment  
- Offering paid support, consulting, or integration services that involve the software

If your use case generates revenue, it is considered commercial and **requires a separate license**.

---

## 4. Can I modify the software and share it publicly?

Yes, but with conditions:

- You must clearly attribute the original work to **Daniel McCoy Stephenson**  
- Your modifications must also be licensed under **Preponderous-NC**  
- You may not monetize or commercially distribute your modified version  
- You must not bypass or remove authentication or licensing checks

---

## 5. Can I remove or bypass the authentication system?

No. The **authentication layer** (such as [`UserAuth`](https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/userauth)) is part of the license enforcement mechanism.  
Bypassing or altering it violates the license and will result in termination of your rights to use the software.

---

## 6. I want to use the software commercially. How do I get a license?

You must obtain a separate commercial license from the author.

Contact:  
**Daniel McCoy Stephenson**  
GitHub: [https://github.com/danielmccoy](https://github.com/dmccoystephenson)

Commercial licenses are negotiated individually to ensure ethical use and proper attribution.

---

## 7. Is this license OSI-approved?

No. The **Preponderous-NC** license is a custom, source-available license.  
It is inspired by **CC BY-NC 4.0** and **BSL 1.1**, but tailored for server-hosted and interactive software.

---

## 8. What happens if I violate the license?

If you use the software in a way that violates the license:

- Your rights to use the software are **immediately terminated**  
- Access may be revoked through authentication/license key controls  
- A **DMCA takedown** may be filed against infringing distributions  
- Legal action may be pursued for unauthorized commercial use

---

## 9. Does the license apply to all Preponderous Software projects?

No. Only projects that **explicitly** include this license in their `README` and `LICENSE.md` files are covered under **Preponderous-NC**.  
Other projects may be licensed differently.

---

## 10. Where can I learn more about the license?

- [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) – Full license text  
- [README.md](./README.md) – Overview and purpose  
- [SPDX-USAGE.md](./SPDX-USAGE.md) – Tagging and compliance guidelines

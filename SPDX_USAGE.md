## 📜 SPDX Identifier

The official SPDX identifier for this license is:

```
LicenseRef-Preponderous-NC
```

> **Disclaimer:** *Preponderous Software is not a legal entity.*  
> All rights to works published under this license are reserved by the copyright holder, **Daniel McCoy Stephenson**.

## ✅ When to Use

Use this SPDX identifier **only** for works that:

1. Are explicitly licensed under the **Preponderous Non-Commercial License (Preponderous-NC)**  
2. Include the full license text in a `LICENSE.md` file within the same repository  
3. Are owned by **Daniel McCoy Stephenson**, even if developed under the Preponderous Software GitHub organization

---

## 📂 Example: Source File Header

For a source file (e.g., `.java`, `.py`, `.js`), place the SPDX identifier at the top, along with a copyright notice:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Preponderous-NC
// Copyright (c) 2022–2025 Daniel McCoy Stephenson. All rights reserved.
```

## 📄 Example: Documentation File Header

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Do not** use `LicenseRef-Preponderous-NC` for projects under other licenses  
- ❌ **Do not** replace the SPDX identifier with `CC-BY-NC` or `BSL` — these are only *inspirations*, not the actual license used  
- ❌ **Do not** omit the copyright notice — it must always name **Daniel McCoy Stephenson**

## 🔍 Automated Compliance

Tools like [FOSSology](https://www.fossology.org/), [ScanCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit), and GitHub’s [license scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) can detect the `LicenseRef-Preponderous-NC` tag.

This helps ensure that:

- License usage is correctly tracked  
- Non-commercial restrictions are respected  
- Commercial violations can be identified quickly
